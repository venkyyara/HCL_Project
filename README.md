# HCL_Project
 My project is to build an informative bot.
 And I have done it using BASH SCRIPT in linux operating system
 Open terminal in linux or ubuntu and type sh file_name.sh.
 so my files are main.sh and firefox.sh.
 To run main.sh the command is "sh main.sh".
 To run firefox.sh the command is "sh firefox.sh".
Now I have added 6 features to my bot.
You can see those features in main.sh.
And also done 1 feature "firefox.sh".
