# HCL_Project
 My project is to build an informative bot.
 And I have done it using BASH SCRIPT in linux operating system
 Open terminal in linux or ubuntu and type sh file_name.sh.
 So my file is Informative_Bot.sh.
 To run Informative_Bot.sh the command is "sh Informative_Bot.sh".
 Features of my Informative Bot are file_management, System_handling, Whatsapp_chat, Firefox_Search, System_Info, Password_Manager, Date&Time.
For password manager, I have used SQLite as backend database to store the username, password and app(reference).
To do that create a database named "database.db" and create a table named "store" with 3 columns named as "username", "password", "app" in SQLite.
Explore the features provided for my bot.
